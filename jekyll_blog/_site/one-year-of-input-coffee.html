<h2 class="post_title">One Year of Input Coffee</h2>

<p>On May 25th of last year I started keeping track of my focused practice time for a few things I wanted to get better at. As mentioned in <a href="../blog/input-coffee-v2">this post</a>, I was motivated by reading <strong>Make It Stick</strong> and the idea that getting better at something didn’t always feel like progress simply because it should be hard.</p>

<p>I built a really basic time tracking tool, which turned out to be a really strong motivator. Seeing a graph of my practice time each week made me want to keep focused.  Here’s the graph from the past year:</p>

<p>I didn’t do as much as I had hoped but I feel like I made some decent progress.  My final numbers were:</p>

<p><strong>guitar: 81 hours</strong> (128 posts)</p>

<p><strong>art: 21 hours</strong> (39 posts)</p>

<p><strong>chess: 5 hours</strong> (10 posts)</p>

<p><strong>vocals: 1 hour</strong> (2 posts)</p>

<p>Obviously I wasn’t that focused on vocals and I kind of gave up on chess pretty quickly, but I made a decent showing for guitar work.</p>

<p>I didn’t let myself count noodling while watching TV or going to band practice. This had to be focused practice where I was really trying to learn something new or fix something sloppy or work on a skill I was lacking. I would have liked to hit 100 hours but 81 is still a lot more than I’ve put in any year prior.</p>

<p>Art was a mild success. I did count my time doing <a href="../blog/inktober-2015">Inktober</a> because a lot of that was drawing novel subjects, but a lot of the other work was fundamental practice and sketchbook work. I also spent some time ramping up with drawing digitally, which I now use a lot for <a href="http://lookatmeimaracecar.tumblr.com">Look At Me I’m a Racecar</a> comics.</p>

<p>This Input Coffee project has really been helpful in getting me to work on skills that I actually care about. Over the next year I’d like to hit 100 hours of guitar and branch out a bit to some under-practiced skills I’d like to have.</p>
