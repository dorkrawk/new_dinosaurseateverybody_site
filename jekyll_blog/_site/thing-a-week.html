<p>I like New Years resolutions. Sure they’re kind of cheesy and I always tend to make similar resolutions each year (run more, get better at guitar, write more music, update <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com">Mount Saint Awesome</a> more regularly, etc.) but I still enjoy the excuse to take stock and think about things I want to be doing.</p>

<p>A lot of what I want to be doing is making things and in order to stay focused on that I’m going to steal an idea from the brilliant <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a> (of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYodWEKCuGg">Code Monkey</a> fame!) and try to do <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/primer/thing-a-week/">A Thing A Week</a>. While Jonathan did this entirely with songs I’m going to branch out to include almost anything that I can create within the 1 week time frame. This might involve building a guitar pedal or brewing a beer or making some art or creating a small web app or piece of software or even… writing and recording a song. I have a bit of experience with this schedule from the early days of Mount Saint Awesome. Back when I first started the comic I was VERY dedicated to posting a comic every Monday and I stuck with that schedule for over a year. It really helped me improve as a cartoonist. Here is the <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com/band/1/1.php">first comic</a> I posted and here is one of the <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com/band/3/10.php">later plot based comic I posted</a> (this was less than 1 year of comics, but still a noticeable difference.)</p>

<p>The first thing I’m going to try is building an HTML5/JavaScript game. I’ve been doing web development for a long time now but I’ve never built a game and it seems like a good excuse to play with some new HTML5 stuff, plus I’d really like to get more serious about JavaScript. If all goes to plan I will have a game to show off here next Monday!</p>
