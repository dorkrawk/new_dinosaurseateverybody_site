This last week I built something cool that was actually in the spirit of the Thing a Week project!</p>

<p>Last Christmas my mom got me a distance sensor that could be easily used with an Arduio (which is a totally normal gift) and I finally got around to playing with it. I had originally wanted to start working on some sort of robot but first I wanted to just play around with it and see what I could do.</p>

<p>After running through a few tutorials I decided it would be fun to make some sort of crude musical instrument using the distance sensor. I learned a bit about how to hook up a tiny speaker and then used the value of the distance sensor specify which tones to generate.</p>

<p><img src="../blog_media/theremino1.jpg" class="inline_left" />
This created something that just constantly made steady sine wave sounding noise. I wanted to add the ability to do start and stop notes so I attached a small pressure sensor to the project. Then the tone would only play if you were pressing down on that sensor.</p>

<p>I also added a small LED light that turns on when a note is being played because lights are neat.</p>

<p>Because you control the instrument by moving one hand around, like you would on a theremin I decided to call my new creation a <strong>theremino</strong> (like theremin + Arduino… get it?). Unlike a theremin, the theremino plays discrete notes from a regular chromatic scale, changing notes every 4cm you move your hand from the sensor. It has a range from B2 to C6.</p>

<p>As you can see from the video below this instrument is actually kind of hard to play. It’s tough to be accurate with your notes when moving around in mid air.</p>

<p>It had been a while since I had tinkered around with an Arduino, so this what a really fun little project. For those interested, I have the the Arduino code for this project available <a href="https://gist.github.com/dorkrawk/d871b15ea69638be710f">here</a> and a wiring diagram for the Ardunio and breadboard <a href="../blog_media/theremino_bb.png">here</a>.</p>
