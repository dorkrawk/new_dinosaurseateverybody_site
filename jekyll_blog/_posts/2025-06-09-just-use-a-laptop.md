I'm in this picture. And I'm just fine with it.

You should just use a laptop. For most things.

Phones are amazing because they're a powerful computing device that is always with you, but they're kind of awful for that same reason. When you can always pull out your phone to take care of a task, do your shopping, etc. you're always trying to do multiple things at once. If you can do it now you never have the excuse to plan to do it later. This has two pretty crappy consequences: 

First, you never have to prioritize things. You just do them as soon you think of them. Maybe you're multitasking during dinner to get things done that don't actually matter. It's really easy to end up busy but not productive.

And second, it's harder to fully focus on your task.
