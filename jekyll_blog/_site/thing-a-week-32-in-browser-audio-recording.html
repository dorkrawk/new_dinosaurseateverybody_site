<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 32 - In Browser Audio Recording</h2>
<div class="post_date">September 2, 2014</div>

<div class="post">
<p>This week my major work was around building an in-browser audio recording system. I’ve been reading about using new HTML5 APIs to get access to the user’s mic (and camera) for a while and I was finally able to sit down and start building something out. Because I feel the need to name everything I build, I had to name this as well. None of the bands I was in ever really practiced or recorded in a garage, they mostly worked out of basements. As a bit of a nod to (and departure from) Garageband, I decided to just call my recording stuff <strong>Basement</strong>.</p>

<p>The core technology for this whole process is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NavigatorUserMedia.getUserMedia">getUserMedia()</a>. This is what prompts the user to allow the page to access the mic (or camera or whatever) and then handle a <code class="highlighter-rouge">LocalMediaStream</code> object. From there you can work with whatever is being picked up by the mic.</p>

<p>Outputing the audio in real time was very easy (hey I built a monitor!) and after doing a bit of research I found a fantastic library to help with the recording aspect of this project: <a href="https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs">Recorderjs</a>. It provides a nice <code class="highlighter-rouge">Recorder</code> object to work with and, best of all, it’s a VERY small, easy to understand library so I can go through every line of code and understand exactly what is being done. This is very important because all of this in-browser media work is very new and deep tutorials are rare. Plus I’m going to need to do a few things that haven’t been done perfectly yet.</p>

<p>Right now I’m working on taking the recorded audio, which exists as a Blob tied to the page it was created on, and sending it back to the server to be uploaded in a way that works nicely with our existing <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> system. I’m really digging into some of the new HTML5 APIs for all this work and it’s been really interesting.</p>

<p>The in-browser recording is the last new major feature we need to build before polishing up the <a href="http://www.reclaboratory.com">RecLaboratory</a> site (which I updated this week, too!) for a very early, very small beta. I’m really excited to get people using this tool soon!</p>
