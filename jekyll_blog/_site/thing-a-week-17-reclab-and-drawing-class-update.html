<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 17 - RecLab and Drawing Class Update</h2>
<div class="post_date">May 5, 2014</div>

<div class="post">
<p>This week, while I was busy with the first week of my new job, I did manage to get some RecLab work done. Also, I’m a few weeks into my drawing class, so I wanted to post an update from that.</p>

<p>While not the most productive RecLab week, I did finish the basic comment functionality for Users, Songs, and Tracks. I also learned about <code class="highlighter-rouge">seed.rb</code> and wrote some seed code for the Instruments data. The trick there was that I wanted to be able to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake db:seed</code> multiple times, so I needed seed code that would let me update or create records. I ended up with a nice solution that lets me break the instruments down into separate arrays by family and then loop through everything to create or update:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">instruments</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">strings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"strings"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">woodwinds</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"woodwinds"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">brass</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"brass"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">percussion</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"percussion"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">keys</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"keys"</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">other</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"other"</span><span class="p">]]</span>

<span class="n">instruments</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="n">instr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Instrument</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">name: </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">first_or_initialize</span>
    <span class="n">instr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">family</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">instr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">save!</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now I’ll need to use a tagging system to attach both Instruments and general Tags to objects. I’m leaning toward <a href="https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on">As Taggable On</a>, which apparently was written by an old childhood friend of mine. Awesome!</p>

The art class is going well. Value and shading are still pretty tough for me because I’ve spent the last few years just doing line drawings for comics. I also have a tendency to draw pretty lightly (which is probably also a result of erasing pencil lines for comics). I don’t think I’ll leave this class a brilliant artist, but but I’m certainly learning things and getting better.</p>
