I like New Years resolutions. Sure they're kind of cheesy and I always tend to make similar resolutions each year (run more, get better at guitar, write more music, update [Mount Saint Awesome](http://mountsaintawesome.com) more regularly, etc.) but I still enjoy the excuse to take stock and think about things I want to be doing.

A lot of what I want to be doing is making things and in order to stay focused on that I'm going to steal an idea from the brilliant [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) (of [Code Monkey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYodWEKCuGg) fame!) and try to do [A Thing A Week](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/primer/thing-a-week/). While Jonathan did this entirely with songs I'm going to branch out to include almost anything that I can create within the 1 week time frame. This might involve building a guitar pedal or brewing a beer or making some art or creating a small web app or piece of software or even... writing and recording a song. I have a bit of experience with this schedule from the early days of Mount Saint Awesome. Back when I first started the comic I was VERY dedicated to posting a comic every Monday and I stuck with that schedule for over a year. It really helped me improve as a cartoonist. Here is the [first comic](http://mountsaintawesome.com/band/1/1.php) I posted and here is one of the [later plot based comic I posted](http://mountsaintawesome.com/band/3/10.php) (this was less than 1 year of comics, but still a noticeable difference.)

The first thing I'm going to try is building an HTML5/JavaScript game. I've been doing web development for a long time now but I've never built a game and it seems like a good excuse to play with some new HTML5 stuff, plus I'd really like to get more serious about JavaScript. If all goes to plan I will have a game to show off here next Monday!
