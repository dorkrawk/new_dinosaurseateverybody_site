This year I've been thinking more about making computers/the internet [fun again](../blog/pragmatic-divesting-from-enshitifcation). Part of this was trying to use more technology without an "agenda". And that has led me into the arms of Linux.

Last year I picked up a [Framework 13](https://frame.work/laptop13) laptop so I'd have a Windows machine to play Minecraft on with my kid. It's been useful to have around, but Windows 11 was just glaringly aggressive with how much it wanted me to sign up for various Microsoft services. I probably hadn't used a Windows computer for anything non-trivial since Windows 7 and the change was striking.

I got the urge to try dual booting Linux on my Framework so I installed Ubuntu and used DHH's [Omakub](https://omakub.org/) to get it set up quickly. It was kind of fun and I've been using as my primary dev machine for working on [Lox](../blog/building-a-programming-language-in-crystal). Having a project has been helpful for just exploring the system a bit and I found myself switching back and forth between Windows and Ubuntu pretty often on that computer. Omakub really did a good job of making things look nice and providing some good defaults so I didn't spend a ton of time getting things set up and usable. I dug in to using Neovim as my editor and Alacritty as my terminal.

**It's nice to have things both configured AND configurable.**

When I saw DHH talking about [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) I was interested. Arch always seemed a little intimidating and I wanted to spend my time using my computer, not fixing/configuring it so having some good defaults and a little hand-holding on the install seemed nice. I was almost relieved when I saw that you couldn't dual boot it (so I couldn't replace my Ubuntu setup). But my curiosity got the best of me. I found an old 2012 MacBook Air, bought a USB-eithernet adapter (so I could run the install without wifi working), and put the ISO on a thumb drive.
