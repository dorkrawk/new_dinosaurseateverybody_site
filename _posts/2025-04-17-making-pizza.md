I like making pizza.

When I first started it was pretty arduous. I actually had to grind the wheat to make flour for the dough. Making the cheese took forever. Toppings were a luxury unless I could find someone else who was making them and even then they could be really expensive.

As time went on, things got easier, though. I was able to buy bags of nice flour. Cheese was easy to get and a wide range of toppings became available. If I was really in a hurry, I could even find pre-made sauces that were pretty good. 

More and more people got into making pizza so there were lots of new recipes out there to try, which was fun too.

Eventually I started seeing pre-made dough and even full kits with dough sauce and toppings ready to assemble and bake, which was pretty nice when I was in a hurry and just wanted something basic.

Then pizza delivery services popped up. I could just order whatever kind of pizza I wanted and it would show up at my door, faster than I could make one myself! Some of them were pretty good and it's a really easy way to get dinner when you're too busy to cook.

So now I have pizza whenever I want, which is pretty cool. I probably eat pizza more often now than I ever have.

I guess I don't really make pizza anymore, though.
