<p>Once again I didn’t have a great Thing a Week week. I actually didn’t even get to the point of planning a project for the week. But I did accomplish one thing: <strong>I got a new job</strong>.</p>

<p>I spent a bunch of time this week prepping for and going on interviews and on Thursday I accepted a position as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer at <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/">Couchsurfing</a>. Today was my first day and so far it’s an awesome gig. The office is amazing, it’s full of dogs, and I get lunch and dinner provided everyday by the staff chefs. The work seems like it will be a lot of fun too. I’m doing Rails development and it seems like I’ll be able to have a lot of say in how the product gets architected.</p>

<p>While it wasn’t the most productive Thing a Week week, getting a new job certainly qualifies this as a pretty productive life week.</p>
