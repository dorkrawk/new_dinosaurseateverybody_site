<p>I like making pizza.</p>

<p>When I first started it was pretty arduous. I actually had to grind the wheat to make flour for the dough. Making the cheese took forever. Toppings were a luxury unless I could find someone else who was making them and even then they could be really expensive.</p>

<p>As time went on, things got easier, though. I was able to buy bags of nice flour. Cheese was easy to get and a wide range of toppings became available. If I was really in a hurry, I could even find pre-made sauces that were pretty good.</p>

<p>More and more people got into making pizza so there were lots of new recipes out there to try, which was fun too.</p>

<p>Eventually I started seeing pre-made dough and even full kits with dough sauce and toppings ready to assemble and bake, which was pretty nice when I was in a hurry and just wanted something basic.</p>

<p>Then pizza delivery services popped up. I could just order whatever kind of pizza I wanted and it would show up at my door, faster than I could make one myself! Some of them were pretty good and it‚Äôs a really easy way to get dinner when you‚Äôre too busy to cook.</p>

<p>So now I have pizza whenever I want, which is pretty cool. I probably eat pizza more often now than I ever have.</p>

<p>I guess I don‚Äôt really make pizza anymore, though.</p>
