<h2 class="post_title">Darwinning, My Ruby Gem for Genetic Algorithms</h2>
<div class="post_date">November 11, 2013</div>

<div class="post">
<p>Well, this writeup is a bit late. I wanted to write about Darwinning right after I launched it but here we are.</p>

<p><strong>So, what is Darwinning?</strong></p>

<p>Darwinning is a Ruby Gem built to help people write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>.  I got into genetic algorithms while taking a machine learning course during my masters and I’ve had a casual interest in them ever since. I even wrote <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com/comic.php?id=30">a comic</a> about them! I have also been enjoying Ruby lately, so I wanted to learn how to build a Gem. This project was started to satisfy both of those interests.</p>

<p>I also played with the Ruby unit testing framework, RSpec, for the first time with this project.  The test coverage for Darwinning isn’t great, but at least it’s a start.</p>

<p><strong>So, how do I use Darwinning?</strong></p>

<p>Darwinning is totally available via <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/darwinning">RubyGems</a> so you can install it the same way you would install almost any Gem:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gem <span class="nb">install </span>darwinning</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once it’s installed you can make use of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Population</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Organism</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gene</code> classes to build your own genetic algorithm based programs.</p>

<p>Here’s an dumb example of how you might use Darwinning to solve a pointless problem:</p>

<p>Let’s say for some reason you need a set of 3 number that add up to 15.  This is a strange problem to have, but let’s solve it anyway.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Triple</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Darwinning</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Organism</span>

  <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Triple"</span>
  <span class="vi">@genes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>

      <span class="no">Darwinning</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gene</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"second digit"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">)),</span>

    <span class="p">]</span>

<p>This code declares an organism class that inherits from Darwinning’s Organism parent class to represent solutions.  Then we create a population of these solution organisms and evolve the population until a solution meets the fitness threshold or the generation limit is met.</p>

<p><strong>So, what else can I do with it?</strong></p>

<p>If any of this sounds remotely interesting to you, please check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/darwinning">Github</a>. I’m always happy to take good pull requests if other people want to contribute. I haven’t been very active lately because I’ve been spending a lot of time on <a href="http://dinosaurseateverybody.com">this website</a> and my <a href="http://daveandeileen.com">wedding website</a>, but I do keep an eye on the project.</p>
