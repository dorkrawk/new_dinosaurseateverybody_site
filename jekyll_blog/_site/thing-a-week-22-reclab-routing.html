<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 22 - Reclab Routing</h2>
<div class="post_date">June 10, 2014</div>

<div class="post">
<p>This was a pretty busy week. I ended up flying back to Chicago on Thursday for my bachelor party, which was really awesome! These good times didn’t leave a lot of time for building things but I managed to get some interesting routing work done on the Reclab site.</p>

<p>I want Reclab to namespace songs and tracks by username, similar to the way Github namespaces <a href="https://github.com/dorkrawk/darwinning">repos</a>. Obviously I also want to use nice identifiers for the resources rather than just id numbers, so I started by setting up <a href="https://github.com/norman/friendly_id">FriendlyId</a>, which is a great gem for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>What’s really cool about FriendlyId is that it can generate a slug that is unique across multiple fields in the object. For example, I want to allow user1 and user2 to both be able to have a song name “My Song One” so I want the path to each song to be something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">user1/songs/my-song-one</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">user2/songs/my-song-one</code>. Note that the song identifier “my-song-one” is only locally unique, not globally unique. To do this FriendlyId lets you scope slugs:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">FriendlyId</span>
<span class="n">friendly_id</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">use: </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:slugged</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:finders</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:scoped</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="ss">scope: :user</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, in order to get things to work with ActiveAdmin I had to make Songs “owned” by Users. If you don’t do this, ActiveAdmin tries to use the FriendlyId slug as a globally unique identifier. This is an easy fix in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/admin/song.rb</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">ActiveAdmin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">register</span> <span class="no">Song</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:user</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I still need to clean up the routing in the rest of the app but this was a big step forward to some nicer paths.</p>
