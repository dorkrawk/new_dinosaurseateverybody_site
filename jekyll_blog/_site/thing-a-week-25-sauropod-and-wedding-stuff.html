<h2 class="post_title">Thing A Week 25 - Sauropod and Wedding Stuff</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>As seems to be the trend lately, last week was <strong>very</strong> busy. Between work stuff, wedding stuff, seeing a <a href="http://triassicparq.com/">musical</a>, and going to a <a href="http://verucasalt.com/">show</a> it was hard to find time to get extra things done.</p>

<p>Almost all of the weekend was devoted to knocking off extra wedding things, like designing take-home gifts for guests and buying a bunch of ties. There is a big list of things that we apparently need to do, but we’re making good progress on it.</p>

<p>We had a really productive <a href="http://reclaboratory.com">RecLab</a> meeting on Tuesday where we worked out some good layout stuff and got the feed stuff into a good place. With the basic feed working, I am now able to move on to the audio player component: <strong>Sauropod</strong>.</p>

<p>Why is called Sauropod? Well a while ago I had to build an HTML5 based mp3 player for a job interview and I decided to call it 5auropod because ‘sauropod’ kind of sounded like ‘iPod” and the ‘5’ because of HTML5. Also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda">sauropods</a> are cool, enormous dinosaurs. When I started working on a player for RecLab I wanted to use the same name, but I was worried about starting JavaScript variables with a number so I just used “Sauropod”. Convoluted, I know, but it makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Right now Sauropod is in it’s VERY early stages, mainly just building out method names to architect the system. The basic idea is to build a library to work with songs and tracks that contain metadata and possibly multiple audio tracks that need to be played simultaneously or adjusted individually. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js">Howler.js</a> to handle most of the audio heavy lifting. It’s been pretty awesome so far. I’m also trying out <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> to give me a bit of functional programming in JavaScript. This is mainly to make working with arrays nicer, which I will have to do quite a bit with the arrays of Howler.js Sounds that make up songs.</p>

<p>Sauropod is still in it’s very early stages, but I have a pretty good architecture planned out and I’m excited to see it develop.</p>
