<p>So last month I found out that Dan “Soupy” Campbell from <a href="http://www.thewonderyearsband.com/">The Wonder Years</a> put out a solo record under the name <a href="http://www.aaronwestandtheroaringtwenties.com/">Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties</a>. I was rightfully excited by this because the record, We Don’t Have Each Other, is one of the best albums I’ve heard in a long time. The storytelling and imagery are amazing. Dan does a beautiful job of painting a scene in every song. It’s like listening to an incredibly well written short story, but there’s fantastic music to go with it.</p>

<p>I had been sketching the other day and I found it was a lot easier to decide on something to draw if I started with a box, like I would when drawing comics. I was looking for a subject for some comic-like art and decided to do a drawing for every song on this record. The scene-setting and exposition in these songs made them a perfect subject and it ended up being a really fun project. Some of the scenes I drew were just snapshots of things described in the lyrics and for some I took a few interpretive liberties.  I recommend <a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Aaron_West_and_The_Roaring_Twenties/album/We_Don%27t_Have_Each_Other/">listening to the record</a> while checking these out. Enjoy!</p>

<p>I’ll probably post these on <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com">Mount Saint Awesome</a> soon, but this seemed like more of a project than a comic, so I wanted to do a blog post first.</p>
