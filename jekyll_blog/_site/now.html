<div class="post">
<p>So I added a <a href="https://dinosaurseateverybody.com/now">Now</a> page to this site.</p>

<p>The purpose of a now page to write up what you’re doing right now. Basically what you’d tell someone if you were catching up and they asked “So what have you been up to lately?”. The idea has been attributed to <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a> (who apparently is the guy who created CD Baby!).</p>

<p>Why did I add one? Do people really care what I’m up to now? I don’t know. But I’ve been growing a bit disenchanted with the state of the internet lately. It feels like a lot of people trying to squeeze posts in between ads on a handful of social networks. I miss when the internet was more distributed and a bit more personal and weird. This felt like a little push in that direction.</p>
