<div class="post">
<p>So once again I participated in <a href="http://inktober.com/">Inktober</a> this year, trying to do a drawing every day of October based on the provided prompts. I only got 12 days in this year but I was pretty happy with the results. I felt like they turned out better than <a href="http://dinosaurseateverybody.com/blog/inktober-2015">last year’s drawings</a> and I guess that’s always the goal.</p>

<p>I think my favorites from this group are the lonely space man, the tired dad, and the girl with her lizard.</p>

<p>The prompts for the drawings I did (in order) are: hungry, sad, hidden, jump, worried, scared, wet, escape, squeeze, tired, box, and friend.</p>

<p>I also posted these to <a href="http://mountsaintawesome.com/comic.php?id=113">Mount Saint Awesome</a>, just so I don’t completely forget that I have a comic.</p>
